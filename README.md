# reel_app

This app needs some UI detailing but this the first time of me using firebase.
it was a good challenge for me but i didn't get enough time for this app because i had other college work to do i hope this gets accepted

## Getting Started

This app takes phone Number authentication for login.
and then  
the user can upload reels to it with having a description and a title for it
and then watch it.
there is also a like button fot it if the ther user likes it
message also pops up when the number is invalid  or otp is invalid
the user stays logged in until he/she logs out
